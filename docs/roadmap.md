# Roadmap

**One API endpoint. Any backend. Local first, cloud when needed. Zero configuration.**

Nexus is a control plane for heterogeneous LLM inference — it routes requests and enforces policies; backends handle the heavy lifting.

## Version Details

### v0.1 — Foundation

The initial release established Nexus as a working LLM gateway. Core infrastructure includes an in-memory backend registry with concurrent access (DashMap), background health checking with configurable intervals, and mDNS auto-discovery of Ollama and exo backends. The intelligent router scores backends by capability match, load, and latency using an exponential moving average. Model aliases allow friendly names (e.g., `fast` → `mistral:7b`) with up to 3-level chaining, and fallback chains provide automatic failover when a preferred model is unavailable. A full CLI (clap) supports `serve`, `backends`, `models`, `health`, `config`, and `completions` subcommands.

### v0.2 — Observability

Added production-grade observability. Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`) expose request counters, latency histograms, and backend gauge metrics. A real-time web dashboard is embedded in the binary (rust-embed) with WebSocket-based live updates for backend status, model changes, and request history. Structured request logging provides per-request trace context with configurable output format (JSON or pretty-print) and per-component log levels.

### v0.3 — Cloud Hybrid

Extended Nexus from a local-only gateway to a hybrid local+cloud control plane. Cloud backend support (OpenAI, generic OpenAI-compatible) adds API key management and tiktoken-based token counting. Privacy zones enforce structural guarantees — backends are tagged as `local`, `restricted`, or `public`, and requests with sensitive data never route to public backends. Capability tiers ensure overflow only targets same-or-higher tier backends. Inference budget management tracks token spend with configurable limits and graceful degradation policies.

---

### v0.4 (Phase 2.5) — Quality, Embeddings & Queuing

Added intelligence features that make Nexus smarter about backend quality and request handling. Quality tracking ([#173](https://github.com/leocamello/nexus/issues/173)) profiles backend response quality — tracking success rates, error rates, and latency per model to inform routing decisions. The Embeddings API ([#174](https://github.com/leocamello/nexus/issues/174)) adds `/v1/embeddings` support with capability-aware routing to Ollama and OpenAI backends. Request queuing ([#176](https://github.com/leocamello/nexus/issues/176), [#177](https://github.com/leocamello/nexus/issues/177)) holds requests when all capable backends are at capacity instead of rejecting immediately, with priority support via the `X-Nexus-Priority` header.

---

## What's Next (v0.4 — remaining)

The remaining **Intelligence** features for v0.4:

- **Speculative Router (F15)** — Pre-analyze requests to predict optimal backend before payload inspection

---

## Non-Goals

These remain permanently out of scope:

1. **Distributed inference** — That's exo's job; Nexus routes to backends that handle this
2. **Model serving** — Nexus doesn't run models, it routes to servers that do
3. **Model management** — No model downloads, conversions, or storage
4. **GPU scheduling** — Backends manage their own resources
5. **Training/fine-tuning** — Inference only
6. **Stateful session management** — Clients own conversation history (OpenAI API contract)

---

## Architectural Principles

1. **Zero Configuration** — mDNS discovery, sensible defaults, "just run it"
2. **Single Binary** — Rust, no runtime dependencies
3. **OpenAI-Compatible** — Strict API adherence; metadata in `X-Nexus-*` headers only
4. **Stateless by Design** — Route requests, not sessions; clients own conversation history
5. **Explicit Contracts** — 503 with actionable context over silent quality downgrades
6. **Precise Measurement** — Per-backend tokenizer registry, VRAM-aware fleet management
