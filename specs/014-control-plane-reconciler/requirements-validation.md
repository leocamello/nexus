# Requirements Validation Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate spec quality BEFORE implementation begins  
**Type**: Requirements Quality Gate  
**Created**: 2026-02-16  
**Feature**: Control Plane — Reconciler Pipeline (RFC-001 Phase 2)  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-16

## How to Use

1. Complete this checklist after writing spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md
2. Mark `[x]` for items that pass
3. Mark `[-]` for items not applicable to this feature
4. Fix any `[ ]` items before proceeding to implementation
5. Goal: 0 unchecked items before creating feature branch

## Section 1: Constitution Gates (Mandatory)

All gates must be explicitly addressed in the specification.

- [x] REQ-001: **Simplicity Gate** checked? (≤3 main modules, no speculative features, simplest approach)
- [x] REQ-002: **Anti-Abstraction Gate** checked? (Direct framework use, no wrapper layers)
- [x] REQ-003: **Integration-First Gate** checked? (API contracts defined, integration tests planned)

## Notes

- REQ-007 N/A: This is an internal architectural refactoring, not an API endpoint change
- REQ-042 N/A: No explicit throughput targets; performance is <1ms per pipeline execution
- REQ-046 N/A: Budget/policy config is via TOML only, no env var overrides needed
- REQ-050 N/A: No network calls in the reconciler pipeline itself (agents handle network)
- REQ-057 N/A: Internal architecture; no user-facing README changes
